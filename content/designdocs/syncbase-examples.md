# Overview

To validate the Syncbase data model, we wrote design docs for a wide variety
of apps.  These docs focused on the interactions with Syncbase and the schema
they would use for storage and synchronization.  There are many variations on
the features in the apps and many ways to implement those features, so these
docs are not intended to represent the only way to build these apps.  Instead,
these docs are intended to provide inspiration while designing your own apps.

## Coffee Catalog

Allows a user to browse and place orders from a catalog containing coffee and
related paraphernalia.
