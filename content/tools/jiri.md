`jiri` is a multi-purpose command-line tool originally designed to aid Vanadium
development. The `jiri` tool has since been extracted from Vanadium and is now
used by various multi-repository projects.

`jiri` is open source and is available here: https://github.com/vanadium/go.jiri

The "fetch repositories" step of [Vanadium installation](../installation.html)
installs the `jiri` tool in `$JIRI_ROOT/devtools/bin`.

Run `jiri help` to learn more about the tool. (Note, this command assumes your
`PATH` contains `$JIRI_ROOT/devtools/bin`.)
